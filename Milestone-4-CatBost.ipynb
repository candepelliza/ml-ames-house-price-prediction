    "### 1.a. Literal Description\n",
    "\n",
    "For this final step of the project we introduce the CatBoost algorithm as a promising technique for predicting house prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "CatBoost (an acronym derived from \"Categorical Boosting\") is a gradient boost decision trees algorithm, which has been specifically designed to effectively handle categorical variables, through a technique called \"ordered boosting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A gradient-boosted trees algorithm means mainly three things: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting:** Attempts to predict a target accurately by building a sequence of weak and simple models, improving on each model based on the error comitted on the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trees:** Uses binary decision trees as base predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient:** The improvements between one and the next model are calculated using the gradient descent method.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while CatBoost shares these bases with other well-known algorithms, such as XGBoost or LighGBM, it differs from those models by two main factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordered Boosting:** While some other similar algorithms have the ability to handle categrical variables, they do it generally through a technique called Target Statistics (or variations of it), which has been demostrated to have a prediction shift due to target leakage. CatBoost presents an alternative that addresses this issue by means of \"ordered boosting\". This technique relies on the ordering principle, introducing a random permutation of the training samples at the different steps of gardient boosting (Prokhorenkova et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree Symmetry:** Contrary to some other algorithms, in CatBoost trees are split consistently (using the same condition) across all nodes at the same depth of the tree (Wong, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.b. Why are we choosing CatBoost?\n",
    "After this introduction to CatBoost algorithm, we can affirm that one of its main highlights is the efficient categorical variables encoding, which has been shown to outperform some other similar algorithms (Prokhorenkova et al., 2017). This characteristic is the main reason that led us to choose CatBoost as our 4th Machine Learnig model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building and analyzing the results of the previous models, in which we used one-hot encoding (OHE) technique for handling categorical variables, we realized that this pre-processing step was causing some issues. As it was explained in the previous notebooks, OHE transforms each category inside a variable into a new individual variable, where the rows labelled with that category has a value of 1 and the rest 0. While this is one of the most extended techniques for dealing with categorical variables, it presents the issue of highly increasing the amount of variables, potentially converting highly significant variables into multiple low-importance ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "This issue was clearly observed in our project, where some categorical variables that showed a high importance during EDA, where converted into multiple independent variables with really low importance in the final models. This issue leads us to think that CatBoost can present an efficient alternative to handle this issue, expecting significantly better results."

    "## 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the project, we will upload the original raw dataset. Different from the previous notebooks, in which we used directly the preprocessed and split training and test datasets, here the preprocessing step will be carried on again. This is because, as it was said before, one of the main advantadges of CatBoost algorithm is the fact that it can deal with categorical variables. Therefore, we need to re-apply the data processing steps to our dataset, leaving out the encoding of categorical variables. \n",

For this, we create a cross validation object with 5 folds. This cannot be directly created using the instantiation of the StratifiedKFold object because such an object will only be useful in a classification problem. Where stratification is carried out on the target variable. Since we need to stratify based on an independent variable, `neighborhood` , we need to create the splits accordingly and then convert them into a CV object which can be passed to GridSearchCV function.
